    "<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Abstract: </p>\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: center;\"> This tutorial demonstrates how to effectively fine tune and evaluate a Faster CNN model using the birdsai dataset of night time infrared images from drones in Southern Africa. The tutorial starts with how to best set up the data for the fine tuning, then the process of fine-tuning and evaluating the Faster CNN model. The resulting model is one that can be used to classify thermal signatures identified by drones at night time as either being that of a humnan or animal, which can support anit-poaching and conservation efforts. </p>\n"

    "Wildlife conservation increasingly relies on thermal imaging drones to monitor protected areas. Distinguishing humans (potential poachers) from animals presents unique challenges due to similar heat signatures. This tutorial applies transfer learning with pre-trained CNNs for this specialized classification task.\n",

    "Unlike existing tutorials that focus on standard RGB images, our approach addresses thermal imagery's unique characteristics while integrating systematic experiment tracking for reproducibility."
